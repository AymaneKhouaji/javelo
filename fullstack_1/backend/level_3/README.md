Users can have more control over the expected completion of the objective by creating milestones.

A milestone is a point with an accomplishment value and a date on which the associated objective should have reach such a value.

The expected accomplishement between milestones (and between a milestone and one of the start or end point) is still linear.

The excess is still calculated with the expected completion at the date of a record, the value of this record and the starting point.
