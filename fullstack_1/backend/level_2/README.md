# Level 2 : Temporal progression

In order to help the accomplishment of each objective, start and end dates are furnished.

Objectives are expected to be completed linearly during these dates.

Each record is now dated. Meaning its value can be compared to the expected completion of the corresponding objective at that date.

The `excess` is calculated as the percentage that represents the difference between those two values over the relative expected accomplishment.
